# analyzing_CIA_factbook_with_SQL

For this project, I worked with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/) that contains statistics about all the countries on earth. It contains demographic information like the follwing:

* `Population` - the global population
* `Population growth` - the annual population growth rate as a percentage
* `area` - the total land and water area 

I used SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from this database. I explored the avearge population,maximum and minimum population and pouplation growth and countries with these population numbers. I also explored the outliers and densley populated countries.
